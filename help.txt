<color:0000ff>================
<color:00ffff>Welcome to TheBlackParrot's Mining Gamemode!
<color:ffffff>This is under heavy development, so bugs and weird things are bound to occur. Please report them immediately if you come across any.
<a:github.com/TheBlackParrot/blockland-mining>GitHub repository</a> <color:999999>|| <a:github.com/TheBlackParrot/blockland-mining/issues>Issue tracker
<color:ffee00>A <a:github.com/TheBlackParrot/blockland-mining-gui/blob/master/Client_Mining.zip?raw=true>GUI is available</a>, <color:ffee00>click the link to download it. Place it in your Add-Ons folder and then restart Blockland.
<color:ffffff>When submitting a bug report, <color:ffee00>mention the version you see here: <color:11aaff>%%VERSION.
<color:ff00ff>==-- GAMEMODE INFO --==
<color:ff00bb>-- BRICK GENERATION --
<color:ffffff>Unlike the traditional mining mode, mining down... actually won't help you. Brick generation has been split into "biomes".
<color:ffffff>These "biomes" contain the ores you can mine, and they're not dependent on your position. Some contain rarer ores, some contain more common ones.
<color:ffffff>Biomes are player-generated, meaning essentially they're not pre-generated. You have the ability to expand, and destroy biomes by mining it, or mining around it.
<color:ff00bb>-- WHERE'S MY PICKAXE? --
<color:ffffff>I've done away with the idea of a pickaxe, and have decided to go a route more similar to Starbound's "Matter Manipulator". Just click and hold to "manipulate matter".
<color:ffffff>Instead of upgrading the power of your pickaxe like every other mining gamemode, you upgrade your Manipulator's <color:ffee00>power <color:ffffff>and <color:ffee00>speed. <color:999999>(so far)
<color:ffffff>Cash isn't used to upgrade it either; I've actually done away with cash for the time being. You collect ores to upgrade your power and speed individually.
<color:ffffff>Power and speed are also separate, feel free to upgrade one but not the other.
<color:ff00bb>-- SAVING/LOADING --
<color:ffffff>Both saving and loading is automatic. Every time you mine <color:ffee00>any brick<color:ffffff>, your game saves. Crashes + data loss is a thing of the past.
<color:ffffff>Your game loads when you enter the server, and it would be pointless to re-load your data manually due to the way it saves.
<color:ffffff>Your data is fine, trust me.
<color:ff00ff>==-- TRADING --==
<color:ffffff>Trading is done via the /trade command. Think of the syntax as follows: <color:ccffff>You want to trade [player] some ore (yours) for some ore (theirs).
<color:ffffff>An example: <color:ffee00>/trade <color:ffee00>Blockhead182731 <color:00ff00>16 copper <color:ffee00>4 gold
<color:00ff00>(you) <color:ffee00>(them)
<color:ffffff>In this case, you would give away 16 copper to Blockhead182731, receive 4 gold from them, and vice versa for them. They would receive 16 copper, and give away 4 gold to you.
<color:ff00ff>==-- CHANGELOG --==
